The user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter allows users to select the platform and time period for analysis. The tool helps developers, project managers, and stakeholders to identify trends, patterns, and bottlenecks in their code review process, optimizing their workflow and improving efficiency. 

This open-source project is available on Github for contributions to its continuous improvement and expansion.

The theme used for this application is developed by: https://github.com/rdbende/Azure-ttk-theme.git
